# Wefox Map

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deeleman/wefoxmap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deeleman/wefoxmap)

This repository hosts the a POC project to showcase the capabilities of Angular for rapidly bootstrapping advanced web projects. It depicts a fictional geo loclization application enlisting Wefox offices visually on a map.

A **live demo** is available at https://wefox-map.herokuapp.com.

This project was generated automatically from an instance of [NGX-Starter Project](https://github.com/deeleman/ngx-starter), built on top of [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Running the application in dev mode

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Generating new Angular artifacts

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Building the application for production

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/wefox` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running the unit tests

The project features a shallow TDD layering, with the purpose of showcasing how easy is to implement advanced unit testing in Angular. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
